
# Pokemon App

- I didn't use any library in this app, because any library is a black box. Any third party library reduce security. It's very hard to find and fix problem in library 
- I used MVVM with depency injection for implementing unit-testing
- I used Mocks in unit-testing. 
- I wrote my own NetworkLayer, because I need only three requests. For my needs it's enough. So I didn't use third party library for that.
- I covered by unit test all view models.  
- I implemented search for pokemon list by name.
- I created debouncer for searching pokemon by name.
